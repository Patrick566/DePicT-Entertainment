            Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey, hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is the 13-part sequel to Carl Sagan’s 1980
            landmark television documentary Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. This series invokes potent story-telling elements
            that profile heroes of science spanning 5,000 years, along with the now-famous cosmic calendar in which the
            13.8 billion year history of the universe is mapped onto the 12-months of the year, and an impossibly
            minimalist vessel that empowers Tyson to move through space and time—from the past, through the present,
            into the future. All this, combined with stunning visual effects and a stirring sound track from Alan
            Silvestri, enables you to not only learn about the universe, but to know and feel your place within it.

            From the frozen tundra in the north to the dry forests of the equator, Sir David Attenborough narrates a
            compelling view of the planet. "Planet Earth" was the first natural history documentary to be filmed in high
            definition, and now a decade later improved technology has made it possible to capture further details, from
            elusive animal behaviors to previously inaccessible remote landscapes. In addition to exploring the
            wilderness, the series examines urban dwellings, focusing on animals that have adapted to city life.
